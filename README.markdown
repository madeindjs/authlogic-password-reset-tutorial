# Authlogic Password Reset Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial will help you set up password reset restfully, with
[Authlogic](http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic).
This tutorial is based on
[this blog post](http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/11/16/tutorial-reset-passwords-with-authlogic/).
Hopefully, having the tutorial as a Git repository, it will be more up
to date.

To reset a password, the user goes through these steps:

1. The user requests a password reset
2. An email is sent to the user with instructions
3. The user verifies their identity by using the link in the email
4. The user is presented with a simple form for updating the password

This tutorial includes all code, including tests. Below you'll see the
tools that are used. If you're not familiar with any of them, check
them out or replace them with your favorite tools.

_Note that this tutorial assumes you have your user and user session stuff already set up._


## Perishable Token

Perishable token as the name implies is a temporary string. Authlogic
use it for simple identification. Add a column called
**perishable_token** to your table and Authlogic will basically handle
the rest.

Generate the migration:

~~~bash
$ rails generate migration add_perishable_token_to_users
~~~

The migration contents:

~~~ruby
class AddPerishableTokenToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :perishable_token, :string, :default => "", :null => false
    add_index :users, :perishable_token
  end

  def down
    remove_column :users, :perishable_token
  end
end
~~~

Don't forget to migrate the database:

~~~bash
$ rake db:migrate
~~~

## Password Resets controller

Next up we add a controller called _password resets_:

~~~bash
$ rails generate controller password_resets
~~~

With this contents:

~~~ruby
class PasswordResetsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :load_user_using_perishable_token, :only => [ :edit, :update ]

  def new
  end

  def create
    if @user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
      @user.deliver_password_reset_instructions!
      flash[:notice] = "Instructions to reset your password have been emailed to you"
      redirect_to root_path
    else
      flash.now[:error] = "No user was found with email address #{params[:email]}"
      render :new
    end
  end

  def edit
  end

  def update
    @user.password = params[:password]
    # Only if your are using password confirmation
    # @user.password_confirmation = params[:password]

    # Use @user.save_without_session_maintenance instead if you
    # don't want the user to be signed in automatically.
    if @user.save
      flash[:success] = "Your password was successfully updated"
      redirect_to @user
    else
      render :edit
    end
  end


  private

  def load_user_using_perishable_token
    @user = User.find_using_perishable_token(params[:id])
    unless @user
      flash[:error] = "We're sorry, but we could not locate your account"
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end
end
~~~

Add this route:

~~~ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :password_resets, :only => [ :new, :create, :edit, :update ]
~~~

### Views

#### Action: new

~~~erb
<h1>Reset Password</h1>

<p>Please enter your email address below and then press "Reset Password".</p>

<%= form_tag password_resets_path do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :email %>
  <%= submit_tag "Reset Password" %>
<% end %>
~~~


#### Action: edit

~~~erb
<h1>Update your password</h1>

<p>Please enter the new password below and then press "Update Password".</p>

<%= form_tag password_reset_path, :method => :put do %>
  <%= password_field_tag :password %>
  <%= submit_tag "Update Password" %>
<% end %>
~~~

## Functional test

Create a user in fixture *test/fixtures/users.yml*

~~~yml
me:
  id: 1
  email: madeindjs@gmail.com
  firstname: Alexandre 
  slug: alexandre
  lastname: Rousseau
  activated: true
  password_salt: <%= salt = Authlogic::Random.hex_token %>
  crypted_password: <%= Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512.encrypt("20462046" + salt) %>
  persistence_token: <%= Authlogic::Random.hex_token %>
  perishable_token: <%= Authlogic::Random.hex_token %>
~~~

and now update your Unit Test like this

~~~ruby
class PasswordResetsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest

  setup do
    @user = users(:me)
  end

  test "should get new" do
    get new_password_reset_url
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should create " do
    post password_resets_url, params: {email: @user.email}
    assert_redirected_to root_url
  end

  test "should get edit" do
    get edit_password_reset_url
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should update" do 
    put password_reset_url(@user.perishable_token), params: {user: { password: "newpassword" } }
    assert_redirected_to user_url(@user)
  end

end
~~~


## The mail
As you might noticed, in the password resets controller there is a
method call on the user to **deliver_password_reset_instructions!**.

Lets add that method to the user model:

~~~ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def deliver_password_reset_instructions!
    reset_perishable_token!
    UserMailer.deliver_password_reset(self).deliver_now
  end
end
~~~

And test it:

~~~ruby
test "should delivering password instructions" do
  assert_empty @user.perishable_token
  @user.deliver_password_reset_instructions!
  assert_not_empty @user.perishable_token
end
~~~

Add the mailer method:

~~~ruby
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def password_reset_instructions user
    @url = edit_password_reset_url(user.perishable_token)
    mail subject: "Password Reset Instructions", to: user.email
  end
end
~~~

### Mailer view

~~~erb
<h1>Password Reset Instructions</h1>

<p>
  A request to reset your password has been made. If you did not make
  this request, simply ignore this email. If you did make this
  request, please follow the link below.
</p>

<%= link_to "Reset Password!", @url %>
~~~


### Test
Test the mailer:

~~~ruby
class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  context "delivering password reset instructions" do
    setup do
      @user = Factory(:user)
      @user.deliver_password_reset_instructions!
    end

    should "send an email" do
      assert_sent_email do |email|
        email.subject =~ /Password Reset Instructions/
        email.body =~ /#{@user.perishable_token}/
        email.body =~ /Password Reset Instructions/
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~
